## My Process
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 Markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

Learnt basic HTML5 and CSS properties.

I learned how to center a div and how to use CSS properties.

### Continued development

I want to learn and understand more HTML elements and CSS properties and how to position divs easier.
I also would like to learn about different units such as rem, em and px.

I want to master HTML5 and CSS before I start on JavaScript and learn frameworks like react.
